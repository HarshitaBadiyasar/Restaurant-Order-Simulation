# Restaurant-Order-Simulation
- Developed a simulation system with time quantization for restaurant operations, & taking into consideration customer
behaviour modelling fit in.Implemented data structures like queues, priority heaps and arrays for efficient event management
- Demonstrated advanced technical proficiency in complex simulation system development. Careful order priority allocation
was implemented for realistic restaurant operations, showcasing skills in simulation modeling and data structure
